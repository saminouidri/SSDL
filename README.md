## What is SSDL?
SSDL, or SUROX's Stable Diffusion Launcher is a tool to manage a local Stable Diffusion Installation, without having to manually launch the webui batch script.

## Usage:

To start, the installation path must be set at least once. Once the webui batch script's has been saved, subsequent startups will read the environement variable,
so there's no need to set it again. 

Command line arguments can be directly configured, and when applied, the batch file is automatically edited, removing the need to manually do so.
